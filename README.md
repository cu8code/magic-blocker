# Magic Block

Magic Block is a Chrome extension designed to address distractions in a novel way. It allows you to access certain websites only after solving a given card for a fixed period. This approach reduces the urge to visit distracting sites while promoting spaced repetition for better learning habits. Users can create custom datasets and share them once the project is complete.
